### This lab will follow on from the homework and build a 1d-CNN

#### Colab version   

You can run through all the steps; and see how the model is train on the Coversational AI dataset.
At the end you need to load pretrained embeddings from Stanford's GloVe project. Note,
there is a step to download these embeddings in the book.
       
Let's go to the lab at [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/119a6K6r_aRNccyMdIaSInhXTmaLPDD2N?usp=sharing).

#### NX version

You can do most of this on the NX as well for an extra credit.  Just use this container: ```https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:l4t-ml```
